# What is prosody
**Prosody** can be defined as the additional information in a person's speech other than the actual content, for example: intonation and melody of a sentence, the rhythm, loudness, timbre, quality of the voice and much more.

When listening to prosody, we can understand the subtext of the sentence, for example:
1. Attitudes and intentions such as: irony, sarcasm, question, command
2. Emotional states of the speaker
3. Medical conditions such as neurological diseases
     
# What we are trying to do
We explore the question of is there a general method to determine **whether a feature is prosodic?**
We are trying to create a **"Prosodic language"** that can be a common ground to compare between different features and rank them according to the "amount" of prosodic information they carry.

# How does it sound
Here are some examples from our self-collected Hebrew data-bases of three different phrases with two types of prosodies: neutral and question:

# Our Work
## TSD - Text Speech & Dialouge Conferance, the check republic, 2018
In this conference we are going to intreduce our first step. A criterion that we developed, that can measure a feature and, determine whether it convey prosodic information and provide a numerical score for that feature.

## ICSEE 2018
In this conference we are going to intreduce a validation of PFC that shows usage of different feature set. We replaced our 48 original features with 4,500 features that was taken from OpenSMILE tool kit.
More details and the actual paper will be uploaded soon.

## More validation tests

These days we are still developing and validate the PFC with extended database, including different languages and mulriple prosodies. We are also formed a stronger mathematical formalition for the PFC.
